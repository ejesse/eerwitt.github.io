[ArnoldC](https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC) is an incredibly fun esoteric language based on quotes from Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. The keywords are easy to comprehend but putting them together in order to make anything more than a "Hello World!" example can be frustrating.

I tried to build Pascal's Triangle in ArnoldC in order to investigate how a language constructed of quotes might look with a complete program. My hope was that I would come out with a scene from a movie in the source code. Unfortunately I did not end up having a script and instead found that it now looks like any other programming language. When I start to look at it my brain begins to parse it and soon I am thinking about ArnoldC code as if it were code I actually use for real projects!!!

Without any commercial breaks, here is Pascal's Triangle in ArnoldC.
